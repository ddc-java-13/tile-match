## Current State

Currently Tile Match is a fully functional game with intuitive navigation between the Home screen, Game screen, Settings screen and High Scores screen. The Settings and High Scores functionality are currently unimplemented. The Settings screen is intended to include selectors for game difficulty and different image selection for tiles, currently the image selection option is unimplemented.

There are several visual elements that are not yet implemented in the game.
* When a tile scheme is selected it is intended that an image from this selection would appear as the background image in all non-game screens, the game screen would be dedicated to gameplay.
* The buttons in the game are intended to be simple in nature but a gradient effect would make them more appealing while keeping to a simple design.

Stretch Goals for Tile Match.

* Difficulty settings for gameplay.
* Score keeping and display in the High Scores screen.
