## Summary
Tile matching is a game where players flip pairs of tiles in order to find matching images. When a match is discovered the tiles are removed from the playing surface otherwise the tiles are flipped face down. The time and number of selections required to clear all tiles are recorded for display in a score summary screen.

## Functionality
* A new game will generate random tile arrangements from one of several art oriented repositories by keyword. Players will attempt to get a match by selecting pairs of tiles. Matching tiles are removed from the playing surface. Play continues until all tiles have been removed.


* The game will track the number of matching attempts a player makes in a given game as well as the total amount of time it takes to clear all tiles. The score will be recorded as well as the date the game was played to allow players to save their best records as well as track their improvements.
