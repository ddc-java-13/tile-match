## Introduction

The Tile Match game project is intended to produce a simple matching game where images hidden until clicked and when all matching pairs are revealed the game ends. The app has a simple and intuitive design allowing players to easily navigate between screens weather intending to start a new game, change their settings or view their game history. Completed games are saved and display the number of matching attempts made and the time it took to complete a puzzle allowing players to track their improvements over time.

I chose to develop this app because I wanted an exercise in game development and this project provided several interesting design puzzles. There is still a huge array of unexplored design space within this project, ranging from image selection options to game size and multiplayer functionality. With time experience and resources, I feel this project could be enhanced into a viable app store game.

The game currently features a single game play difficulty. The image selection for the tiles in the game are being pulled from a free online hosting service (Pixabay.com). Completed games are saved to an internal database.
